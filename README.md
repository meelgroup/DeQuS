# Program Synthesis as Dependency Quantified Formula Modulo Theory
Currently, we focus only on the theory of bit vectors.  sl2dqbf takes a SyGuS instance in bit vector theory and convert it to DQBF instance. We will release the source code in the first half of June 2020 (before IJCAI conference). Stay tuned.
